# Testimonials

"It feels like a freer version of Facebook. Like I don’t have to fear being lashed out at for posting how I feel about a subject, big or small simple or weighty. It’s very inviting. Will be a mighty feat of light for the social media world if you can keep it that way!!!!" - JH 2/1/2021

"Your mission to create a safe and healthy space on and offline is exciting. I believe the world would greatly benefit from models to understand how they can help themselves and others through communication" - HP 1/8/2021

"I'd like for the higher level rooms at xbk.io to be places of genuine safety, where people can be seen and heard AS THOUGH THEY WERE PRIVATELY JOURNALING (wow) and be met with "love", compassion, empathy, excitement, etc. I have been able to create this sort of experience irl even with groups of strangers, and the result feels deeply nourishing and healing - systematized "healthy intimacy". I think this manner of learnable relating, unshaming, being seen and loved, can literally save humanity. And I am here building xbk.io because I believe I can bring it to the world." - Founder 1/24/2021 http://xbk.io/posts/-MRpYn-aq1wQ2GiTJBZe
