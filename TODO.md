# FOCUS

- manifest a handful of regular active users
- build for constructive conversation
- healthy relating, productivity, health

# TODO

- user join timestamp
- user most recent login/action/active timestamp
- security, seriously
- backups
- phone users may be confused about no submit buttons for replies/tags/etc
- allow like or heart or read or something on replies or all posts
- chess+
- optional display names?
- private rooms for conversations, games, etc?
- user profiles
- picture handling
- Long tags break UI
- Ability to delete your own tags
- can't see stats tables on phones very well; they're at bottom of post feed
- tags on replies?

### SECURITY & DEV

- implement database backups
- database security rules should prevent clients from reading any private data
- are client-visible userIds a concern?
- firebase security & permissions deep dive
- more protect from accidental wipes, eg overwrites to zero in game
- abstract posts' and collections' functions into models and utils etc
- better react props handling
- elevate user to global
- move game data out of user objects

### Tier 2 (user convenience etc)

- confirm prompt for delete post
- ability to edit your existing posts
- ability to share pictures
- better handling for orphan posts
- direct links to posts

### NEW USERS AND PARTICIPATION

- stats for top tag getters and by tag type
- order of stats tables is good as is?
- invite codes and family-tree displays and stats for top inviters ?

### MONETIZATION

- add backend app to complete Stripe payment gateway
- add purchasables
- save successful card info (PCI compliance!?)

### IDEAS

- notifications / cool stuff you might care to see since you last logged in
- who's online now
- private rooms like worlds w game-ified invites / vote-off-island / scores etc
- auto-curated feed universal and personal, eg most active recent posts
- view posts feed by filters: user, tag
- groups -> rooms / post feeds / chat rooms

### UTILITIES

- movies seen w ratings and reviews; books, etc
- new names networking/contacts/friends utility
- scorekeeper as part of rooms

### GAMES

- humans game modeling reality, eg mood meter
- make game fun
