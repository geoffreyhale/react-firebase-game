# TODO

- improve visibility of "hot" topics/posts; get as many eyes/additional-activity on the "hot" (replies etc) as possible
- sent j a direct link to single post full of comments for her, she didn't know how to see them;; from notifications, j clicks and doesn't think it linked; she saw the blue no lurking box and even if she read it there wasn't a clear way to post/reply/rejoin-the-conversation
- fix Google auth from apps like Facebook that use embedded browsers
- pin posts/conversations/threads
- save posts/conversations/threads
- favorite posts/conversations/threads
- showHeaderLinkToParent Card.Header could have more helpful informations
- show accurate reply count on user profile posts
- (my) user profile is so slow
- something to let premium members know all they're getting for their money, maybe like the PremiumSaleCard for premium members somewhere
- better document.title tab titles like for rooms and user profiles
- cleanup Posts/index.js
- editor's choice posts
- room specific upvoting etc
- cross site search
- room-specifics like stats, users here now, etc
- manually fix old post links, there's not many of them
- use context for room, remove roomHack
- lift notifications out of rooms in ui/ux
- the mark-post/thread-as-seen button should be more like a universal hide-until-new-stuff; Unseen feed should be obsolute, just a layer available on any other feed
- a top level post (without replyToId) is akin to a thread-head; a thread would keep useful meta-data, eg whether anyone had replied to any message in the thread since you last visited it
- change db 'upvote' to 'upvotes'
- https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-firebase-realtime-database

- develop the end-game, Trust Points or Healthy Relater levels and access to deeper safer rooms for higher safety and vulnerable/charged topics etc

- map out what is healthy relating
- 'Add Tags' to new top level post
- downvotes, or flagging or something
- lowercase all tags ?

- fix double render (still happening? / use more loading)
- clean out Posts index
- posts feed slowness ?
- help user to put it on their phone home screen
- move junk data out of db users, eg groups
- fix the smart feed active indicator, differently weird on desktop and phone ?
- phone users may be confused about no submit buttons for tags
- allow like or heart or read or something on replies or all posts
- optional custom display names?
- community verification for display names
- private rooms like worlds w game-ified invites / vote-off-island / scores etc
- private rooms for conversations, games, etc?
- picture handling, stop querying google for user photos
- ability to share pictures
- Ability to delete your own tags
- confirm prompt for delete post
- better handling for orphan posts; how handle deleting posts?
- stats for top tag getters esp by tag type

- auto-curated feed universal and personal, eg most active recent posts
- view posts feed by filters: user, tag
- groups -> rooms / post feeds / chat rooms
- round tables, eg 5 closest friends, 5 best friends, 5 friends I want to be more like, etc
- are client-visible userIds a concern?
- firebase security & permissions deep dive
- abstract posts' and collections' functions into models and utils etc
