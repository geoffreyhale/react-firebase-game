                  I'm hesitant to include this resource; I consider it a
                  misleading example of ownership language. He injects wacky
                  embelishments, twists for self-empowerment, and hidden
                  formulaic if-then certainties.

                  But it's a video resource which you may like. I find it
                  entertaining. And it's a potential talking point for further
                  disambguation of terms and methodologies.
