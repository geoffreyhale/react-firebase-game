            "Many schools of psychotherapy see subpersonalities as relatively
            enduring psychological structures or entities that influence how a
            person feels, perceives, behaves, and sees him-, herself or
            themselves."

            "IFS posits that the mind is made up of multiple parts, and
            underlying them is a person's core or true Self. Like members of a
            family, a person's inner parts can take on extreme roles or
            subpersonalities. Each part has its own perspective, interests,
            memories, and viewpoint. A core tenet of IFS is that every part has
            a positive intent, even if its actions are counterproductive and/or
            cause dysfunction. There is no need to fight with, coerce, or
            eliminate parts; the IFS method promotes internal connection and
            harmony to bring the mind back into balance."
